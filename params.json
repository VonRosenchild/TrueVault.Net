See their website at https://www.truevault.com for more information.\r\n\r\nThis library is a simple, strongly-typed .NET wrapper around TrueVault's RESTful API.\r\n\r\n###Features (:white_check_mark: Completed and :heavy_minus_sign: Planned)\r\n\r\n- :white_check_mark: JSON Document Store API\r\n- :heavy_minus_sign: BLOB Store API\r\n- :white_check_mark: Search Schema management API (Get/Create/Update/Delete Schemas)\r\n  - :heavy_minus_sign: Search API\r\n\r\n###External Dependencies\r\n\r\n> - ServiceStack.Text 3.9.71\r\n> - AutoMapper 3.2.1\r\n> - NBuilder 3.0.1.1\r\n> - NUnit 2.6.3\r\n\r\n##Release Notes\r\n\r\n###Version 1.0.2\r\n- Implement Search Schema management API\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\n##Instantiation\r\n\r\nCreate a new instance of the TrueVault client, passing in your TrueVault API key, and you're ready to go!\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar trueVaultClient = new TrueVaultClient(\"{TrueVault API Key}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n##JSON Document Store API\r\n\r\n###Creating a  Document\r\n\r\nThis library automatically handles Base64 conversion and serialization. You only need to pass an instance of Type `T` to save it to TrueVault. `T` can be any class with a parameterless constructor.\r\n\r\nA document can be created with or without the optional `schemaId` parameter via the appropriate overloaded `CreateDocument<T>` method.\r\n\r\n###Getting Document(s)\r\n\r\n`GetDocument<T>` is used to retrieve a single document from TrueVault, and will directly return an instance of Type `T`. Base64 conversion and deserialization is handled for you.\r\n\r\n`MultiGetDocuments<T>` retrieves a `MultiDocumentResponse`, which contains a list of `DocumentResponse` in its `Documents` property. You can use the `DeserializeDocuments<T>` method to extract and return the wrapped document instances as Type `T`.\r\n\r\nEach `DocumentResponse` exposes a `DeserializeDocument<T>` method, which extracts and returns the individual document as Type `T`. `DocumentResponse` contains the TrueVault document ID in its `Id` property, as well as the raw serialized Base64 encoded JSON string in its `Document` property.\r\n\r\n###Creating a Schema\r\n\r\nCreate a new instance of `Schema` or `Schema<T>`. Note that even though it has a public setter, **you should never modify the `Id` property of a Schema yourself**.\r\n\r\nYou can pass new instances of `SchemaField` via the `Schema`/`Schema<T>` constructor, or simply add them to the `Fields` List after construction. Check the Intellisense notes for further details about the various properties.\r\n\r\n`Schema<T>` is derived from `Schema`, but it isn't necessary to use this generic version. It simply adds a convenience method, `RegisterNestedField<TNested>`, which accepts `fieldExpression`, which is a `MemberExpression` pointing to a complex property on `T`, and `nestedFieldExpression`, which is a `MemberExpression` pointing to a primitive property on `TNested`. This method will also attempt to determine the TrueVault Schema compatible type of the property on `TNested`. See the Intellisense notes and Unit Tests for further details.\r\n\r\nWhen your `Schema` is ready, call `TrueVaultClient.CreateSchema` to save it, which will return a `SchemaSaveSuccessResponse`, containing a `Schema` property that should be the same as the `Schema` you saved.\r\n\r\n###Getting Schema(s)\r\n\r\nCall `TrueVaultClient.GetSchema` and `TrueVaultClient.GetSchemaList` to get one or all `Schema`s, respectively. The responses will contain a `Schema` or `IEnumerable<Schema>`, respectively.\r\n\r\n###Exception Handling\r\n\r\nWhen the library catches a `WebException`, it will make an attempt to parse and unwrap the `error` object in an error response from TrueVault. It will throw a new `WebException` with the original exception in the `InnerException` property, and a message formatted as follows, where `response` is the error response body returned by TrueVault.\r\n\r\n`TrueVault Transaction ID {response.transaction_id} - {HTTP Status Code} Error (Type: {response.error.type}) [Code: {response.error.code}]: {response.error.message}`\r\n\r\n##Running the Tests\r\n\r\nUpdate App.config in the TrueVault.Net.Test project with the values you wish to use for testing. Please note that the tests use the TrueVault API, so you may incur a small amount of usage by running them. Per the license, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for any usage charges, fees, overages, etc. you may incur by running the tests.\r\n\r\n#Contributing\r\n\r\nPull requests are welcome. If you're planning on adding a major feature, please contact me first to make sure it fits with the direction of the library, and that I'm not already working on it!\r\n\r\n#Legal\r\n\r\nThis library is made available under The MIT License.
